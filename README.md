- [x] Task 1:
	Reading	the	gate	level	net	list	(given	as	JSON),	identifying	the	timing	paths	and	creating
a	DAG.	Output	the	identified	timing	paths. [30%].
- [ ] Task	2:
    Read	 the	library	 file (JSON),	read	 the	net	capacitances file	and	apply	 the	Critical	Path
Method	(CPM) to	find	the	critical	path.	Output	the	identified	critical	path.	[40%]
- [ ] Task	 3:
	 Read	 the	 clocks	 skew file	 as	 well	 as	the	 timing	 constrains	 file	 then	 check	 for	 timing
violations	(setup	and	hold).	Output	the	identified	violations	[20%]
- [ ] Task	4:
	Calculate the	Arrival	and	Required	times	at	each	node	of	the	DAG	as	well	as	the	slacks.
Output	the	slacks	at	all	gates.	[20%]
