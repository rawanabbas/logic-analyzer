- [x] **Task 1**: [30%]
     * ~~Reading	the	gate	level	net	list	(given	as	JSON),	identifying	the	timing	paths	and	creating a DAG.~~
     * ~~Output	the	identified	timing	paths.~~
- [x] **Task	2**:  [40%]
    * ~~Read	 the	library	 file (JSON).~~
    * ~~Read	 the	net	capacitances file.~~
    * Apply the Critical Path Method (CPM) to find the critical	path.
    * Output	the	identified	critical	path.	
- [x] **Task	 3**: [20%]
	* ~~Read the clocks skew file as well as the timing constrains file.~~	 
	* ~~Check for timing violations	(setup	and	hold).~~
	* ~~Output the identified	violations.~~	
- [x] **Task	4**: [20%]
	* ~~Calculate the	Arrival	and	Required	times	at	each	node	of	the	DAG	as	well	as	the	slacks.~~
	* ~~Output	the	slacks	at	all	gates.~~
